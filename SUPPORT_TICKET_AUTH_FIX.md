# Support Tickets - Authentication Fix

## ✅ Issue: 401 Unauthorized Error - FIXED!

### 🔍 The Problem:

**Error Message:**
```
POST https://api.fadsms.com/api/support/tickets 401 (Unauthorized)
```

**Root Cause:**
The Support component was using `localStorage.getItem('token')` but the rest of the app uses `localStorage.getItem('auth_token')`.

**Token Mismatch:**
```javascript
// Support.tsx (WRONG):
Authorization: Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('token')}

// ApiService and rest of app (CORRECT):
Authorization: Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('auth_token')}
```

---

## ✅ The Fix:

### Changed in `src/components/Support.tsx`:

**All API calls now use the correct token key:**

```javascript
// Before (WRONG):
const token = localStorage.getItem('token');

// After (CORRECT):
const token = localStorage.getItem('auth_token');
```

**Applied to:**
1. ✅ `loadTickets()` - Line 53
2. ✅ `createTicket()` - Line 79
3. ✅ `viewTicket()` - Line 118
4. ✅ `sendReply()` - Line 141
